//This is the view that is visible to the users. Our aim should be to keep this really dumb - no calcualtions, business logic, url formations, etc etc...

//We could be using some third-party library instead of trying to write our own view. Althought we have a couple challenges with using a third-party library.
//1. Issues - When relying on is any external code, you also inherit the flaws and baggage they come with. Sometimes its hard to predict in what way those bugs can affect our code.
//2. Performance - Other issues are testing the library, ensuring that its quality is good - memory usage, cpu usage, network, FPS etc... we can potentially save the effort of writing the code but we do have to maintain it.
//3. Lifecycle and Sunset - If the library is actively being maintained and is backed by good open source community then its probably safe to assume that it wont dissappear overnight or any major bugs/(or security falws depending on what is it that you use) would be fixed pronto.
//4. Is it fit for purpose and fit for use? - Other issue is that the often re-usable libraries come with a lot of additional features and options that we probably dont need. So we can always start lite and move to a third-party lib later as well. The point I'm trying to make is, keep it simple and silly.
//5. Lastly, I did try out a few libraries instead of using the List. But I wasn't able to use them straight away. I ran into multiple issues with various libraries.

//For Illustration Only - Notice the difference between the above code and below. Its cleaner and slightly more reusable.

                    .lineLimit(3) //Business logic - Can we change the number of lines?
                    WebImage(url: URL(string: "http://farm\(photo.farm).static.flickr.com/\(photo.server)/\(photo.id)_\(photo.secret).jpg")) /*We can leverage the power of extentions and move this to the FlickrPhoto Entity - this is here on purpose*/
                    .resizable() // Resizable like SwiftUI.Image, you must use this modifier or the view will use the image bitmap size
                    .placeholder(Image(systemName: "photo")) // Placeholder Image - Should this come from a ViewModel? Well its a compoenent of the View as such, so looks alright. But if the business/branding wants the image chnaged? Its business logic, so probably doesnt belong here.
                    .indicator(.activity)
                    .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.5)) //Business logic
                    .transition(.fade)
//                    .scaledToFit()
                    .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)

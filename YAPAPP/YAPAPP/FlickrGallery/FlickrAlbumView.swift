//Alternative approach is to extend respective classes and models instead of using a seperate ViewModel where it makes sense. IMO this is much cleaner and readable and blends in with the language.
//Some things to think about though - Could this be easily readable for existing memebers of the team? What about new members? What if a dev from a different background is joing us?
//I dont have an answer of whats a better way. I prefer chucking all the related extensions in a file and call it ViewModel - in our case PhotoCardViewModel and use them.
//But this is a good candidate for a team vote.

/*
 I tried using a few third-party libraries for trying instead of my ListView approach, but none of them worked for me.
 For now I'm sticking with my approach for 2 reasons,
 1. Thought its dirty, it works - If I waited to perfect this I would not have achieved any better - Quick win.
 2. I could work on creating my GridView for iOS 13 and below because Apple has one for iOS 14 and above.
 The amount of regret-spend (wasted code, time and effort) is minimal and I'm able to progress with an intention to itirate and improve.

I'm sure use of Tuples is intended to aggrandize the code, but you can always use a Struct instead to enhance readability.

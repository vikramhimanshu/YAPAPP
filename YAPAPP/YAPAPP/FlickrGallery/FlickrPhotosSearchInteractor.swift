    //Backward compatibility can be a expensive. We might potentially write extra lines of code:
    //1. Cater to our existing customers.
    //2. At times its about convenience to avoid change (Why touch when its working? - A: Because we needed to add new stuff)
    //3. Announce that old method/API/etc is being migrated to new one - like Apple does
